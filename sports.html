    <br>
    <h4>Best Players</h4>
    <br>
    <p><b>Mark Ramprakash</b> Rachin Ravindra (New Zealand) was outstanding in the tournament’s opening game and his
        level
        barely dropped. He’s a wonderfully talented left-hander, aesthetically very good to watch, who hits the ball
        with elegant power and has a good head on his shoulders. Throw into the mix some probing left-arm spin and
        you’ve got a serious talent with a bright future.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Barney Ronay</b> Mohammed Shami (India). Serious impact in a team already steamrollering the field.
        Fast-medium line
        and length is the new rock and roll.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Ali Martin</b> The ICC confirmed it remains a batter’s game by plumping for Virat Kohli (India). But despite
        his
        avalanche of runs, Shami – purveyor of the most precise seam work outside of Savile Row – was probably the
        standout across the tournament.
    </p>

        <h2>Virat Kohli on his way to his record-breaking 50th ODI century against New Zealand. </h2><br>

    </div>
    <br>
    <p><b>Geoff Lemon</b> An all-round bringer of change, Azmatullah Omarzai transformed Afghanistan from a spin-heavy
        and
        batting-light side. Attacked good bowling, scored quickly, kept composure, often unbeaten, and bowled tough
        overs with at times rapid swing.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> <b>Simon Burnton</b> Openers have averaged more than 50 in World Cups before, but never at the strike rate Rohit
        Sharma
        (India) has sustained in this tournament. Game after game he set the tone for India in the most emphatic style
        and under the greatest pressure, in doing so freeing the rest of his batters to achieve all sorts of ridiculous
        things.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Tanya Aldred</b> Kohli. Exhaled the pressure, despite 48 lifesize cutouts following him to Eden Gardens, 49 to
        Bengaluru. Out-Beckhamed the Kiwis in the semi, made another 50 in the final, before finally being undone by the
        captain of the tournament, Pat Cummins.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Best Matches</h4>
    <br>
    <p>There have been lots of good games but <b>Afghanistan against Australia</b> was surely the most eventful, with
        the rank
        outsiders getting themselves into a position from which they probably win easily 99 times out of 100 only for
        the innings of the tournament from Glenn Maxwell to snatch victory from their grasp.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The <b>Australia v South Africa semi-final</b>, which wasn’t that close in the end and didn’t have fireworks but
        readvertised the umbrella-gnawing beauty of a low-scoring 50-over knockout game.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Maxwell channelling his inner Undertaker in Mumbai, rising from a state of cramped-up rigor mortis to floor
        Afghanistan with the greatest ODI innings of all time. Australia, not always convincing up to this point,
        suddenly dared to dream.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p><b>Australia v New Zealand</b>. A run-fest, but worth it for the ferocity of David Warner and Travis Head taking
        down
        New Zealand’s opening bowlers, then the courage and class of Ravindra and James Neesham in the chase.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> South Africa against Pakistan was the tournament’s first genuine thriller, the former chasing 271 with a wicket
        to spare after Tabraiz Shamsi, who went on to score the winning runs, somehow survived an extraordinarily tight
        lbw decision with eight runs still needed.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p> South Africa v Pakistan: a slow‑burn thriller. Had ebb and flow, Shaheen Shah Afridi in full stride, brilliance
        from Mohammad Wasim and South Africa nine down with 11 needed.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Best Moment</h4>
    <br>

    <p>
        <b> Kohli hitting his 50th ODI ton</b> in the semi-final against New Zealand and then bowing to the great Sachin
        Tendulkar, who finished his career with 49. I was lucky enough to witness and play against Tendulkar and watch
        his magnificent career, and to see Kohli emulating and then surpassing it felt like a moment in history.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>Afghanistan <b>beating the world champions</b>. A significant occasion in cricket history and a moment of pure
        joy for players and fans.
    </p>
    <br>

    <br>

    <p>Funniest, certainly, was Angelo Mathews being timed out. Shakib Al Hasan didn’t blink, <b>the old
            “Spirit of Cricket” debate</b> erupted, officials defended their time-keeping and Mathews posted evidence on
        social
        media to the contrary. What a silly sport.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Maxwell’s salmon impression, flat on his back with cramps in Mumbai before timing another 60 or so runs in the
        most astounding double century the world will ever see. Sporting genius.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Some India players seemed a little overfocused on individual milestones at times, which isn’t really the done
        thing, but hitting a six to complete your first century of the tournament and win a game, as Kohli did against
        Bangladesh in Pune, that’s quite cool.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> David Miller reaching his hundred with a hammer throw of a six off Cummins in the semi-final – holding together
        South Africa’s innings when all seemed lost (ultimately it was).
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>The 50-over World Cup is likely to …</h4>
    <br>
    <p> … go on. With a lack of bilateral 50-over series, there seems to be a view that we can just do without these
        games and gear up for the occasional tournament. It is clear that T20s are going to be the dominant format but,
        with Test cricket fading outside the top three nations, I think ODIs will remain at No 2, and the prestige of
        the World Cup will remain.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>… be remembered fondly in books.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> … live on, given broadcast deals are signed up until 2031. And it should. With the global landscape splitting
        off in two directions, it provides a stage for the best red- and white-ball players to come together and
        compete.
    </p>
    <p> … keep on going for now because India will want to win another before it gets mothballed for good. The
        frustration over this loss, of all of them, will go deep and last long.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        … need teams to take it seriously. It’s a great format. But unless staged just before World Cups bilateral ODI
        series make little sense, and I fear as attention returns to T20s the 50-over game will atrophy quietly in the
        shadows. Ill-prepared teams make for shambolic and unpredictable tournaments (potentially quite fun, in a dirty
        way).

    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        … totter on, despite its squeezed status between T20s and Test matches – though its format must change. The
        round robin might be aesthetically pleasing but it goes on, and on, for an interminably long time.
